Why I want to learn code 
Ben Duffy

Technology is such a big part of my life, especially growing up in today’s youth. Computers, ipad’s, gaming consoles and touch screen phones are all major items of today’s generation. With all this technology it’s hard to keep up to date on how they work. Most schools run classes for how to operate programs but where is the code? It’s easy to use Microsoft word or a website but how do they run? We play games on websites or apps but how do they work? Sure schools can teach us how to use these things but need to understand how they work so we can get an idea if that is a possible career for us in the future. Going through high school is hard. People want you to know exactly what you want to be. How can I know what I want to be when I am not being taught different subjects? Learning code is such an important subject for my generation, so why is it not being brought up at school?

Being a teenager I’m not sure exactly what I want to be when I’m older. I may end up writing an app or designing a website but it will be hard to do that when there is no one to teach me. One of the main reasons I like coding is because of Mark Zuckerberg. Mark Zuckerberg is a person that I greatly admire. After watching ‘The Social Network’ and a few documentaries/videos on YouTube I realised that this particular field of work is very interesting. I would love to be able to write my own app or design my own website; all I need is someone that can help me learn. 

My dreams are to play professional basketball, Umpire AFL football and design company websites. Being a very sporty person it is hard to stay still on a certain thing for long but when i turn on my laptop and start looking at code tutorials i just get sucked in. Hours later ill have a basic webpage made from scratch
